# R2D2 Research

This GitHub repository contains all the toolings and code required to facilitate our R2D2 research project (Hogeschool Utrecht, 2021).

## Communication Protocol

The following section lists the pinouts that are used by the simple communication protocol that we've created in order to transfer data from a Raspberry Pi to a Teensy. Our initial approach was aimed at using existing libraries/protocol implementations to accomplish this. Unfortunately, due to some buffering issues with the Broadcom chip that some of the newer Raspberry Pi models use, we had to resort to writing our own communication protocol.
